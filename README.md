This Flask CRUD application, is a home workout platform. 
I was responsible for the entire development lifecycle, including initial concept, UI/UX design using HTML and CSS, and dynamic content rendering with Flask's Jinja. 
On the backend, I designed and implemented the SQL database schema, along with all data definition and manipulation queries, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval for managing user workout plans. The app facilitates creating, reading, updating, and deleting workouts, demonstrating my full-stack development capabilities.
